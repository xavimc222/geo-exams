Attached scanned class notes.

Extract data from the three maps shown below. There are three maps of European countries: Germany, Poland, Austria.

There are toponyms and other geographical features. Extract all text, organized as xml. Indicate the type of feature (city, region, river, mountain, etc.). Tag all items in both Czech and English language (you will need to translate).

Be exhaustive. Extract also any side notes.

Indicate if the text extracted was located within the map, or at the side. If possible, indicate approximate location of the text label.

---

For the three maps, and information extracted, produce a list of types of information extracted. The list should be the aggregation of all types of information present in any of the three maps. Indicate for each one of the three maps, if any of the information types is missing.

---

in the xml correct hyphenated names such as "Burgen- land" to "Burgenland"

Poland contains a handwritten introduction text at the top. Produce an analogous introduction text for Germany and Austria, containing the same type of data.

Complete regions list for Poland and Germany, similar to Austria. In the xml, add both Czech and English information, following the current pattern.

In the xml, add at least 2 major rivers for Austria and Germany

Remove information of author, map scale and compass from the xml.

In the xml, once the regions are listed for missing countries, add for all countries additional cities to cover homogenously all regions. Add only significant cities, at least one per region.

The objective is to have a consistent set of information across all three countries, with similar level of detail on the information chapters present.

For each item in the xml,

add a tag indicating if it was originally present in the class notes

add a latitude/longitude representative location for cities and regions. Use some internet database. Be exhaustive: all cities and regions need a latitude and longitude tag.
